# Working with API

**Use a web application programming interface (API) to automatically request specific information from a website - rather than entire pages**

**A web API is a part of a website designed to interact with programs. Those programs use very specific URLs to request certain information. This kind of request is called an API call. The requested data will be returned in an easily processed format, such as JSON or CSV.**
